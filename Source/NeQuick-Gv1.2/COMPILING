NeQuick source code can be compiled with any C compiler in any platform. 

Beside the model itself, the test driver NeQuick_command is provided.

A makefile has been provided for compilation with different standard compiler gcc. To select the compiler, change the variable COMMAND in the Makefile and adapt the OPTIONS accordingly. 

Be aware of data filenames case conventions (ccir**.asc, diplats.asc and R12.dat) and also of the type of ascii representation (unix, dos, mac) for the line feed/carriage return depending on the platform. Conversions can be done with unix2dos, dos2unix commands or with emacs editor (directive set-buffer-file-eol-type).
